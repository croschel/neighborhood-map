## Instructions

This is a software developed with HTML 5, CSS 3 and React JS for a project in Udacity. I had used two APIs, Google Maps API and Foursquare.

## Installation

You will need to install npm dependencies (`npm install`) to run this application. After this you have to run the npm server or yarn (`npm start`) with the start command on Terminal. Open your favorite browser
on localhost on 3000 port and be happy.Creat-react-app creates a service worker to cache, but it only works in production mode, so you have to follow this steps:
- npm install -g build
- npm run build

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
